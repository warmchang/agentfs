description: Generate Python SDK for agentfs based on the Typescript SDK
---

## Dev rules

- COMMIT your changes in the end with detailed message with the motivation of changes and traces of your actions
- USE `uv` with `--directory sdk/python` command in order to avoid `cd` to the subdirectory
- ALWAYS USE pathes relative to the project root
- DO NOT EVER `cd` into the directories - tool permissions will not be validated properly
- USE ONLY SIMPLE "ls", "grep", "find", "cat" Bash commands and native Claude Code tools - otherwise permission will be blocked

## Context

- You must generate Python SDK with the API similar to the current Typescript SDK located at ../../sdk/typescript
- You must transfer all tests from Typescript SDK to the Python
- Last time, python sdk was updated based on the comment $1 (if value is "unspecified" then regenerate SDK from scratch; if value is set - focus on the diff between the current state and specified commit hash; note that prompt in .claude directory also can change)
- Use `turso.aio` python package which provide API similar to `aiosqlite`
- Use simple setup with builtin uv ruff formatter
- Use pytest for testing
- Use ty for type checking
- Maintain CI for linting and checking at .github/workflows/python.yml similar to the TS workflow at .github/workflows/typescript.yml
- Maintain CI for publishing the Python package to the PyPI in the .github/workflows/release.yml
  - Use `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret
